- 🚩 All your files should end with a new line
- 🚩 A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- 🚩 Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- 🚩 The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- 🚩 All your *.py files should be executable
- 🚩 All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- 🚩 All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`

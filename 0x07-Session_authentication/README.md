## Background Context
In this project, you will implement a *Session Authentication*. You are not allowed to install any other module.

In the industry, you should *not* implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
## Learning Objectives📖
- 🔰 General
- 🔰 What authentication means
- 🔰 What session authentication means
- 🔰 What Cookies are
- 🔰 How to send Cookies
- 🔰 How to parse Cookies

## Requirements
### General
- 🚩 All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
- 🚩 All your files should end with a new line
- 🚩 The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- 🚩 A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- 🚩 Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- 🚩 The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- 🚩 All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- 🚩 All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- 🚩 A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
